1.	Initialize main program – provide main input file name 
2.	Read main file with list of sources to array
3.	Initialize empty global logic tree object – will add to this as source input is looped
4.	Loop over source list. For each source
  a.	Read input file
  b.	Create source object
    i.	Initialize source variables by invoking instance of source class
    ii.	Populate source variables by reading input file 
  c.	Process source (this step is for area sources e.g., tranzone) 
  d.	Create logic tree node for source
  e.	Add source node to global logic tree object
5.	Process GMPEs, if desired and not already done (put into table, e.g., haztable)
6.	Initialize end branch hazard data structures and mean hazard arrays
7.	Compute end-branch hazard
  a.	Loop unique branch list
    i.	Loop Magnitudes
      1.	Loop M-A scaling relationship
        a.	Loop rupture propagation/ distances
          i.	Loop Frequencies
            1.	Loops GMPEs
              a.	Loop amplitudes
                i.	Compute and store P[exceed]
                ii.	Compute and store weighted contribution to mean hazard
8.	Post-process hazard
